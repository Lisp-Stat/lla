LLA is a high-level Common Lisp library built on on BLAS and LAPACK, but providing a more abstract interface with the purpose of freeing the user from low-level concerns and reducing the number of bugs in numerical code.

There are four main objectives:

- Provide a high-level, user friendly, interface that hides the details.
- Stay in Lisp and expose the innards of the objects as much as possible.
- Keeping it simple; LLA is only about 3000 lines of code.
- Speed is important, but reliability comes first.
